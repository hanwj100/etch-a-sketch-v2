# etch-a-sketch-v2

The primary goal of this project is to build a website that more closely 
emulates a real etch a sketch while solidifying the knowledge learned from the 
previous version. 

Unlike the previous version, this project does not have a focus on DOM
manipulation and will therefore utilize html and css files.
